## Flavor
The peanut butter crunch is my least favorite of the BSN Protein Crisp bars so far. The peanut butter drizzle on the top and the peanut butter dip on the bottom just tastes really artifical.
## Texture
The texture is where the crisp bars shine. It has a crunchy texture and reminds me of a rice krispie treat. This is much better than most protein bars, where they are either mushy or chewy.
## Macros and Ingredients
The macros for this bar are pretty standard for protein bars these days. 6g of sugar alcohol is on the lower end. Likewise, the fiber content is low in this bar. I prefer low fiber and low sugar alcohol, becuase those make me feel bloated.
## Conclusion

The texture of this bar is great, but given the other flavors are much better tasting. I will be reaching for another BSN Protein Crisp bar before I reach for this one.
